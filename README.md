# MySQLOO 9
An object oriented MySQL module for Garry's Mod.
This module is an almost entirely rewritten version of MySQLOO 8.1.
It supports several new features such as multiple result sets, prepared queries and transactions.
The module also fixed the memory leak issues the previous versions of MySQLOO had.
